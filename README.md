# german-to-english
A simple VoIP phone app that can translate German to English in real-time. 

## Problem Statement
While trying to fix a bank issue in Germany, the customer rep blatantly disconnected the call saying - "I don't speak English, call later."
This got me thinking - if there was an application that could translate real-time on-call - things would be so much easier and better.

## Solution Attempt
A simple application that takes the user's voice as input - translates it to German and the customer care rep is able to listen to it. When the rep speaks in German, the voice is translated in real time and I can listen to the voice in English. 

### POC
A web application, that takes my voice as input, translates it, and emits my voice in German. The same system takes another voice in German, translates it to English, and emits the voice in English.
